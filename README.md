# CSCC69-Pintos

Pintos is an educative Operating System Developed by Stanford Univeristy.

The attached tutorial, which is followed in UCB CS-162 course has been taken into consideration for the tasks.

The task has been divided into 3 subtasks:

1) Efficient Alarm Clock

Re-implemented timer_sleep() function in timer.c to remove spinning

2) Priority Scheduler

Introduced various data structures and functions in thread.c and thread.h along with a library fixed-point.h

3) MLFQS Scheduling

The changes were made in thread.c and thread.h along with a toggle option in command line.


Running Test Cases:

a) After compiling change your directory to it (/src/thread/build). 
b) Run make check command. 
c) it wil show you status of all test cases one by one

All the provided test cases were passed.

Challenges:

Since all the individual institutes have their own authentications for logging into virtual machines and connecting to the project, I had to use the Docker container for the OS & VM environment provided Thierry-Sans, which is well expalined in the video: https://youtu.be/7D77e5bm8lw
